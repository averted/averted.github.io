      <description>Classes #  Overview #   Class declarations, unlike functions, are not hoisted All methods are nonenumerable Calling class constructor without new throws an error (new.target always exists)  Classes as First-Class Citizens #  A first-class citizen is a value that can be passed into a function, returned from a function, and assigned to a variable. Every JS Function is a first-class citizen, and Classes are as well (can be passed around as arguments inside a fn).</description>

      <description>Iterators &amp;amp; Generators #  Iterators #  Iterators are objects with a specific interface designed for iteration. All iterator objects have a next() method that returns a result object. The result object has two proerties: value, which is the next value, and done, which is a Boolean that&amp;rsquo;s true when there are no more values to return. The iterator keeps an internal pointer to a location within a collection of values, and with each call to the next() method it returns the next appropriate value.</description>
