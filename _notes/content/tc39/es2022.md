## ES2022

### Class Public Instance Fields & Private Instance Fields
Since ES2015, we could define fields by simply setting them up in our constructors. As a convention, fields that were not supposed to be accessed outside of the class methods were preceded by an underscore, but this did not stop any consumer of this class from accessing them anyway.

```js
class ColorButton extends HTMLElement {

  constructor() {
    this.color = "red"
    this._clicked = false
  }
}

const button = new ColorButton()
// Public fields can be accessed and changed by anyone
button.color = "blue"

// Curse your sudden but inevitable betrayal
console.log(button._clicked) // Prints: false, can be accessed from the instance
button._clicked = true // Doesn't throw an error, can be read from the instance
```

The first part of this proposal offers a more clear way to define the fields in a class. Instead of defining them in our constructor, we can now define, and if we want to, initialize them on the top level of our classes.

```js
class ColorButton extends HTMLElement {
  color = "red"
  _clicked = false
}
```

The second part offers a more secure way of hiding private fields from prying eyes. Instead of the conventional underscore, we can now use a preceding # in the field names to block anybody from accessing them outside of the class they're defined on.

```js
class ColorButton extends HTMLElement {
  // All fields are public by default
  color = "red"

  // Private fields start with a #, can only be changed from inside the class
  #clicked = false
}

const button = new ColorButton()
// Public fields can be accessed and changed by anyone
button.color = "blue"

// SyntaxError here
console.log(button.#clicked) // Cannot be read from outside
button.#clicked = true // Cannot be assigned a value from outside
```
