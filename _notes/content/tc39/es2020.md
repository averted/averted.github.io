## ES2020

### String.prototype.matchAll()
Returns all matches for a global regex.

### Dynamic Imports
Before this, we could only use static imports, which only accepted strings for the module path. With dynamic imports, we got to conditionally import modules by using promises.

### BigInt
A new primitive data type that represents larger numbers.

### Promise.allSettled()
Returns when all given promises are settled (rejected or fulfilled, doesn't matter).

### Optional Chaining Operator(?.)
Legible property chains that don't throw an error if a requested reference is missing. If one of the chained properties is nullish (null or undefined), the whole expression returns undefined.

### Nullish coalescing operator(??)
Binary operator. If the value of the left side expression is null or undefined, the right side of the operator is evaluated.
